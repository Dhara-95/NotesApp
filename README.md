# NotesApp
This Notes App is a single page web app that only uses pure JavaScript. The web app allows a user to input a new note, which displays the first 20 characters and a summary of the full note if it is clicked. In this project no exisiting web frameworks or test libraries were used - instead we built our own basic testing framework to carry out unit tests.

This was our second team project as part of Makers Academy (contributors are listed below).

All user stories below have been implemented.

**Instructions**
----

This web app is hosted on surge (https://surge.sh/) and can be run by clicking the link below:

```
http://nutritious-umbrella.surge.sh/
```

To ensure all tests are passing open the file below in your browser:

```
test_framework.html 
```

Then in your browser follow the steps below to see the number of passing tests in your JS console:

```
- open browser (Chrome advised)
- click on 'View' --> 'Developer' --> 'JavaScript Console'
- navigate to the 'Console' tab where you should see the number of passing tests
```

N.B. The app doesn't connect to a database, therefore if you re-load/refresh the page it will not show any notes you previously entered.
